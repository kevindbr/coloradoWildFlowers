    Colorado Wildflowers contains photographs and information for over 525 plant species growing east
    of the Continental Divide in Colorado. Species listed in Weber and Wittmann's Colorado Flora: Eastern Slope,
    3rd Edition are included.
  </p>

  <p>
    Colorado wildflower species are listed alphabetically by Scientific names, Common names, or Families. Names are
    those
    used by Weber and/or USDA Plants Database.
  </p>

  <p>
    Elevations listed for individual Colorado wildflower species are from herbarium specimens.
  </p>

  <p>
    Times of flowering are estimates based on references and my own observations. They can vary depending on elevation
    and
    climate.
  </p>

  <p>
    Great effort has been made to correctly identify wildflower species. If you believe a species has been
    misidentified,
    please send an email and I will make corrections. This feedback will strengthen the site as a resource.

    Thank you to Sara, Kate and Charlie for their patience during family hikes and for allowing me to dominate our
    computer for several months. Thank you also to my friends and colleagues who have assisted with plant
    identification. And to my parents, whose copy of Eliot Porter's Birds of North America was an inspiration.
